# The log channel defines where your log entries go to.
# Several other options exist. You can use 'single' for one big fat error log (not recommended).
# Also available are 'syslog', 'errorlog' and 'stdout' which will log to the system itself.
# A rotating log option is 'daily', creates 5 files that (surprise) rotate.
# Default setting 'stack' will log to 'daily' and to 'stdout' at the same time.

# - Docker + versions <= 4.8.1.8 and before: use "stdout"
# - Docker + versions >  4.8.1.8           : use "docker_out"
